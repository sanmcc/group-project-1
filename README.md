- The Foundation CSS framework brings the action directly from the screen to your brain!

- This is the winner's page. If the dog wins - the dogs face appears on top of the girl's body and a dog song is available to listen to in the top right of screen. This is the same for a cat if a cat wins as far as the picture and a cat song. In the top left, you can go back to the home page and select new fighters.

# 07 Project 1: Interactive Front-End Application

At the conclusion of each phase of this course, you‚Äôll work with a group of your fellow students to create a **project**. A project is collaborative work among a group of developers to create an application that solves a real-world problem. Projects model the experience you‚Äôll encounter in every development role at any company, from large multinational businesses to small startups. Coding is collaborative.

A project is a bit different from the Challenge assignments you‚Äôve worked on so far. One of the biggest differences is that you‚Äôll no longer build an application by yourself! This has some advantages&mdash;you won‚Äôt have to do all of the work, you can divide up duties, and you can share skills and knowledge with other developers and lean on their strengths. This can also be challenging if you‚Äôre used to working alone. Constant communication and time management are just two of the skills you‚Äôll need to practice to make sure everyone in your group works together to complete the project. 

Projects won‚Äôt provide you with a user story or acceptance criteria, because you and your group will create them once you decide which real-world problem your application will solve. This lack of constraints can be freeing in a way, because you have room to build what you want, but it also means that you have to decide what those constraints are before you can start working.

Finally, a project requires a presentation, because you‚Äôre trying to convince an audience that it serves a purpose. Your instructional staff and fellow students are investors, and you‚Äôre pitching your creation to them&mdash;an experience that developers are required to do frequently. Your presentation is just as important as the actual project, so take it just as seriously.
